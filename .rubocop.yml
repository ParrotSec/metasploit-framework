# This list was intially created by analyzing the last three months (51
# modules) committed to Metasploit Framework. Many, many older modules
# will have offenses, but this should at least provide a baseline for
# new modules.
#
# Updates to this file should include a 'Description' parameter for any
# explaination needed.
