Installing
--

Generally, you should use [the free installer](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/wiki/Nightly-Installers),
which contains all of the dependencies and will get you up and running with a
few clicks. See the [Dev Environment Setup](https://r-7.co/MSF-DEV) if
you'd like to deal with dependencies on your own.

Using Metasploit
--
Metasploit can do all sorts of things. The first thing you'll want to do
is start `msfconsole`, but after that, you'll probably be best served by
reading [Metasploit Unleashed][unleashed], the [great community
resources](https://metasploit.github.io), or the [wiki].

Contributing
--
See the [Dev Environment Setup][wiki-devenv] guide on GitHub, which will
walk you through the whole process from installing all the
dependencies, to cloning the repository, and finally to submitting a
pull request. For slightly more information, see
[Contributing](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
