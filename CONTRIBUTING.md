# Hello, World!

Thanks for your interest in making Metasploit -- and therefore, the
world -- a better place!  Before you get started, review our
[Code of Conduct].  There are multiple ways to help beyond just writing code:
 - [Submit bugs and feature requests] with detailed information about your issue or idea.
 - [Help fellow users with open issues] or [help fellow committers test recently submitted pull requests].
 - [Report a security vulnerability in Metasploit itself] to Rapid7.
 - Submit an updated or brand new module!  We are always eager for exploits, scanners, and new
   integrations or features. Don't know where to start? Set up a [development environment], then head over to ExploitDB to look for [proof-of-concept exploits] that might make a good module.

# Contributing to Metasploit

Here's a short list of do's and don'ts to make sure *your* valuable contributions actually make
it into Metasploit's master branch.  If you do not care to follow these rules, your contribution
**will** be closed. Sorry!

## Code Contributions

* **Do** stick to the [Ruby style guide] and use [Rubocop] to find common style issues.
* **Do** follow the [50/72 rule] for Git commit messages.
* **Do** license your code as BSD 3-clause, BSD 2-clause, or MIT.
* **Do** create a [topic branch] to work on instead of working directly on `master`.
  This helps protect the process, ensures users are aware of commits on the branch being considered for merge,
  allows for a location for more commits to be offered without mingling with other contributor changes,
  and allows contributors to make progress while a PR is still being reviewed.


### Pull Requests

* **Do** write "WIP" on your PR and/or open a [draft PR] if submitting **working** yet unfinished code.
* **Do** target your pull request to the **master branch**.
* **Do** specify a descriptive title to make searching for your pull request easier.
* **Do** include [console output], especially for witnessable effects in `msfconsole`.
* **Do** list [verification steps] so your code is testable.
* **Do** [reference associated issues] in your pull request description.
* **Don't** leave your pull request description blank.
* **Don't** abandon your pull request. Being responsive helps us land your code faster.
* **Don't** post questions in older closed PRs.

Pull request [PR#9966] is a good example to follow.

#### New Modules

* **Do** set up `msftidy` to fix any errors or warnings that come up as a [pre-commit hook].
* **Do** use the many module mixin [API]s.
* **Don't** include more than one module per pull request.
* **Do** include instructions on how to setup the vulnerable environment or software.
* **Do** include [Module Documentation] showing sample run-throughs.
* **Don't** submit new [scripts].  Scripts are shipped as examples for automating local tasks, and
  anything "serious" can be done with post modules and local exploits.

#### Library Code

* **Do** write [RSpec] tests - even the smallest change in a library can break existing code.
* **Do** follow [Better Specs] - it's like the style guide for specs.
* **Do** write [YARD] documentation - this makes it easier for people to use your code.
* **Don't** fix a lot of things in one pull request. Small fixes are easier to validate.

#### Bug Fixes

* **Do** include reproduction steps in the form of verification steps.
* **Do** link to any corresponding [Issues] in the format of `See #1234` in your commit description.

## Bug Reports

Please report vulnerabilities in Rapid7 software directly to security@rapid7.com. For more on our disclosure policy and Rapid7's approach to coordinated disclosure, [head over here](https://www.rapid7.com/security). 

When reporting Metasploit issues:
* **Do** write a detailed description of your bug and use a descriptive title.
* **Do** include reproduction steps, stack traces, and anything that might help us fix your bug.
* **Don't** file duplicate reports; search for your bug before filing a new report.
* **Don't** attempt to report issues on a closed PR.

If you need some more guidance, talk to the main body of open source contributors over on our
[Metasploit Slack] or [#metasploit on Freenode IRC].

Finally, **thank you** for taking the few moments to read this far! You're already way ahead of the
curve, so keep it up!
